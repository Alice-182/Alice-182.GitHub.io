Hello! I'm Alisia (or Jinyi Wan back in China), a tech whiz fascinated by distributed deep learning. From developing systems at Google to delving into neural networks at Microsoft Research Asia, my journey has been a blend of intense academia and real-world challenges. I'm excited to further explore the frontiers of AI. When I'm not coding, you'll find me planning my next adventure – ice climbing this winter at Sichuan's breathtaking 双桥沟. 🌟🏔️✨
