Hello! I'm Alisia (or Jinyi Wan back in China), a tech whiz fascinated by distributed deep learning. From developing systems at Google to delving into neural networks at Microsoft Research Asia, my journey has been a blend of intense academia and real-world challenges. Having enjoyed my Spring and Summer of 2023 in Austin, I'm excited to return to the US in 2024 to pursue my graduate degree and further explore the frontiers of AI!  When I'm not coding, you'll find me planning my next adventure – ice climbing this winter at Sichuan's breathtaking 双桥沟. Welcome to my corner of the internet! 🏔️✨
